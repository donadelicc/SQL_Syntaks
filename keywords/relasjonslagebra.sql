Sure! Here are some common relational algebra symbols along with their equivalent SQL queries:

Selection (σ):

Relational Algebra: σ_condition(R)
SQL Equivalent: SELECT * FROM R WHERE condition
Projection (π):

Relational Algebra: π_attributes(R)
SQL Equivalent: SELECT attributes FROM R
Union (⋃):

Relational Algebra: R ⋃ S
SQL Equivalent: SELECT * FROM R UNION SELECT * FROM S
Intersection (⋂):

Relational Algebra: R ⋂ S
SQL Equivalent: SELECT * FROM R INTERSECT SELECT * FROM S
Difference (−):

Relational Algebra: R − S
SQL Equivalent: SELECT * FROM R EXCEPT SELECT * FROM S
Cartesian Product (×):

Relational Algebra: R × S
SQL Equivalent: SELECT * FROM R, S
Join (⨝):

Relational Algebra: R ⨝_condition S
SQL Equivalent: SELECT * FROM R INNER JOIN S ON condition
Division (÷):

Relational Algebra: R ÷ S
SQL Equivalent: SELECT * FROM R WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM S MINUS SELECT * FROM R)
These examples demonstrate the correspondence between relational algebra operations and their SQL counterparts. Keep in mind that the specific SQL syntax may vary slightly depending on the database management system (DBMS) you are using.
